### 3.1.1 Paragraph
> Gatsby believed in the green light,the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It 
eluded us then,but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our armsfarther…. And 
one fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borneback ceaselessly into the past.
